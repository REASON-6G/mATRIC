    multi-Access Technology Intelligent Controller

# Basic overview 
This repository host the mATRIC software implementation platform, an intelligent RAN controller developed under the [![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/REASON-project)](https://reason-open-networks.ac.uk/about/) project to support multiple wireless access technologies.


**The mATRIC platform supports the following capabilities:**

- Real-time and near real-time scenarios.
- Cellular and non-cellular access technologies â€“ _5G, WiFi, LiFi_.
- Monitoring, intelligence and data analytics.
- Control and optimisation of RAN resources.


# Architecture

mATRIC is comprised of 3 building blocks

1. mATRIC Broker
   (Description)

2. mATRIC OPEN API
